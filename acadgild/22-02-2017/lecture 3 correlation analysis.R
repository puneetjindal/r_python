"""
Correlation is a bivariate analysis that measures the strengths of association between 
two variables and the direction of the relationship.  In terms of the strength of 
relationship, the value of the correlation coefficient varies between +1 and -1.  
When the value of the correlation coefficient lies around Â± 1, then it is said to be a 
perfect degree of association between the two variables.  As the correlation coefficient 
value goes towards 0, the relationship between the two variables will be weaker.  the 
direction of the relationship is simply the + (indicating a positive relationship between
the variables) or - (indicating a negative relationship between the variables) sign of 
the correlation.   Usually, in statistics, we measure four types of correlations: Pearson
correlation, Kendall rank correlation, Spearman correlation, and the Point-Biserial 
correlation.
